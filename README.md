This is my implementation of meanshift algorith.

There are 3 different implementations which give the same results.
Thre is  C implementation using C++ for OpneCV and OpneMP.
Next thre is assembler implementation of meanshif algorithm also with dependencies as mentioneed above.
And las is CUDA implementation. To run this one you will need to hvae nvcc installed and obviously to have CUDA compatible card.

To run all this implementations, you have to have installed OpenCV and OpenMP installed on your system.

The NASM wersion is 64-bit only, the C & CUDA versions might run on 32-bit system.
